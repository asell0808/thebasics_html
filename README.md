# thebasics_html
In depth on HTML elements and their attributes, as well as a future HTML Skeleton installment.

# Info
This index file has examples and/or descriptions of all HTML tags. I plan on basically using this as a skeleton frame W3 reference for myself or future students to go back too. I source W3, and I link back to their site on multiple occaisions.
